elasticHQ
=========

Monitoring and Management Web Application for ElasticSearch instances and clusters.

Goals:
* Provide a browser-based application for active real-time monitoring of ElasticSearch clusters.
* No software to install. (The Java API is nice, but this project will use simple REST endpoints for comm)
* Support for analytics and statistics gathering plugins.
* Support for indexing/queries from the management UI.

WARNING! This software is in active development, and in a nascient stage at that.
You will find it broken, half-working, or if you're very lucky on a rare occasion - fully working.

* Live Demo: http://www.elastichq.org

Requirements
------------
* A Web Browser.
